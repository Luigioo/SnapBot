# SnapBotSIFT

SnapBotSIFT is a program designed to automatically play the Marvel Snap game using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for image recognition. This program utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze the game board, detect Marvel characters, and make intelligent moves to achieve high scores.

## Features

- Automatic Gameplay: SnapBotSIFT takes control of the Marvel Snap game, analyzing the game board and making moves to match characters automatically.
- SIFT Image Recognition: The program leverages the power of the SIFT algorithm to detect and recognize Marvel characters with high accuracy.
- High Score Optimization: SnapBotSIFT employs intelligent strategies to optimize gameplay and achieve the highest possible scores.
- Configurable Settings: Customize the program's behavior and performance through various configuration options, such as search depth, move speed, and image recognition thresholds.

## Requirements

To run SnapBotSIFT, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: The program is developed using Python programming language. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- OpenCV: SnapBotSIFT utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. Install OpenCV by running `pip install opencv-python` in your command line.
- NumPy: The program relies on NumPy for efficient numerical operations. Install NumPy by running `pip install numpy` in your command line.

## Installation

1. Clone the SnapBotSIFT repository from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnapBotSIFT.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```shell
cd SnapBotSIFT
```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Launch the Marvel Snap game on your preferred platform.

2. In the SnapBotSIFT directory, run the following command to start the program:

```shell
python snapbotsift.py
```

3. SnapBotSIFT will automatically analyze the game board, detect Marvel characters using SIFT, and make moves accordingly.

4. Monitor the program's output in the console and observe its gameplay in the Marvel Snap game window.

## Configuration

You can modify the behavior and performance of SnapBotSIFT by editing the `config.json` file. Here are some key configuration options:

- `search_depth`: Adjust the depth of the game tree search algorithm. Higher values may lead to improved gameplay but can also increase computation time.
- `move_speed`: Set the delay (in seconds) between each move made by the program. Modify this value to adapt to the speed of your system and the game.
- `thresholds`: Adjust the image recognition thresholds for character detection. Experiment with different values to achieve optimal results.
